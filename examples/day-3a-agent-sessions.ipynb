If you have a specific area within AI and healthcare you're interested in, I can try to provide more targeted information.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are continuous and exciting new developments in AI-driven drug discovery! This remains one of the hottest and most promising areas of AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key new developments and trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **Beyond predicting:** Instead of just analyzing existing molecules, generative AI models are now being used to *create* entirely new molecular structures with specific desired properties. This is a game-changer, moving from optimizing existing drugs to designing novel ones from scratch.\n*   **\"De novo\" design:** This term is frequently used. AI can be trained on vast chemical databases and then generate molecules that are predicted to bind to a specific target, have good bioavailability, and low toxicity.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are reporting success in generating molecules that are chemically novel and have shown promise in early-stage testing for various diseases.\n\n**2. Advancements in Target Identification and Validation:**\n*   **Unraveling complex biology:** AI is getting better at analyzing multi-omics data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) to identify novel disease targets that might not have been obvious through traditional research.\n*   **Network biology:** AI can help map complex biological networks and identify key nodes or pathways that, when targeted, could have a significant therapeutic effect.\n*   **Predicting target druggability:** AI models are being developed to predict whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning it's feasible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it.\n\n**3. AI in Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n*   **Patient stratification:** AI can identify patient subgroups most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting trial success/failure:** Models are being built to predict the likelihood of a clinical trial succeeding based on various factors, helping companies allocate resources more effectively.\n*   **Synthetic control arms:** In some cases, AI is being explored to generate \"synthetic\" control arms for trials, reducing the need for placebo groups and speeding up trials.\n\n**4. Enhanced Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n*   **AlphaFold's impact:** While AlphaFold from DeepMind revolutionized protein structure prediction a couple of years ago, ongoing work is building on this. AI is now helping to understand protein dynamics, interactions, and how drugs bind to these structures.\n*   **Drug-target interaction prediction:** More accurate protein structures from AI lead to better predictions of how drug candidates will interact with their intended targets.\n\n**5. AI for Drug Repurposing and Combination Therapies:**\n*   **Finding new uses for old drugs:** AI can quickly scan existing drug databases and scientific literature to identify potential new applications for approved drugs, significantly reducing development timelines and costs.\n*   **Optimizing drug combinations:** AI is being used to predict synergistic drug combinations for diseases like cancer, where multiple treatments are often more effective than single agents.\n\n**6. Focus on Data Integration and \"Digital Twins\":**\n*   **Holistic patient data:** Companies are working on integrating diverse datasets – from EHRs, wearables, genomics, imaging, and real-world evidence – to build more comprehensive AI models for drug discovery and development.\n*   **\"Digital Twins\":** The concept of creating virtual replicas of patients or diseases is gaining traction. AI can then be used to test drug candidates on these \"digital twins\" before human trials.\n\n**Key Players and Examples:**\nMany companies are at the forefront, including:\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Known for its vast biological dataset and AI-powered approach to drug discovery.\n*   **Exscientia:** One of the pioneers in using AI for rational drug design, with several AI-designed drugs now in clinical trials.\n*   **Atomwise:** Focuses on using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Another leader in generative AI for drug discovery, particularly in areas like fibrosis and oncology.\n*   **NVIDIA:** Provides the computational power and AI platforms that enable much of this research.\n*   **Big Pharma:** Companies like Pfizer, Novartis, and AstraZeneca are heavily investing in and partnering with AI drug discovery firms.\n\n**Challenges remain,** including the need for rigorous validation, navigating regulatory pathways, ensuring data quality and accessibility, and addressing potential biases in algorithms. However, the pace of innovation is undeniable, and AI is fundamentally reshaping how new medicines are discovered and developed.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Advancements in Target Identification and Validation using AI**. This is a crucial early step in the drug discovery pipeline, and AI is making significant inroads here.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this development entails:\n\n**What is Target Identification and Validation?**\n\n*   **Target Identification:** This is the process of finding a specific molecule (usually a protein, gene, or pathway) in the body that is involved in a disease. The idea is that if you can modulate the activity of this target (e.g., inhibit an overactive enzyme, activate a deficient receptor), you might be able to treat or cure the disease.\n*   **Target Validation:** Once a potential target is identified, it needs to be validated. This means confirming that modulating that specific target actually has a beneficial effect on the disease, and importantly, that it doesn't cause unacceptable side effects. It's about proving the target is indeed relevant and \"druggable.\"\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This Process:**\n\n1.  **Harnessing Massive, Diverse Datasets (Multi-omics):**\n    *   **The Problem:** Modern biological research generates an overwhelming amount of data from various sources:\n        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences, gene expression levels.\n        *   **Proteomics:** Protein levels and their modifications.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA sequences.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** Small molecules involved in metabolism.\n        *   **Clinical Data:** Patient health records, treatment responses, symptoms.\n        *   **Literature Mining:** Vast amounts of published scientific papers.\n    *   **AI's Solution:** AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding complex patterns and correlations within these enormous, heterogeneous datasets. It can:\n        *   **Integrate data:** Combine information from different \"omics\" layers to build a more holistic picture of disease mechanisms.\n        *   **Identify subtle associations:** Detect links between genetic variations, protein expression, and disease phenotypes that might be missed by human researchers or traditional statistical methods.\n        *   **Discover novel pathways:** Uncover previously unknown biological pathways that contribute to disease progression.\n\n2.  **Network Biology and Systems Thinking:**\n    *   **The Problem:** Diseases rarely stem from a single malfunctioning component. They often arise from disruptions in complex biological networks. Understanding these interactions is key.\n    *   **AI's Solution:** AI can construct and analyze these biological networks. It can:\n        *   **Map interactions:** Model how genes, proteins, and metabolites interact with each other.\n        *   **Identify \"central\" players:** Pinpoint nodes within the network that have a significant impact on the overall system. Modulating these central players can be more effective than targeting peripheral ones.\n        *   **Predict cascading effects:** Understand how intervening at one point in the network might affect other parts, helping to anticipate potential side effects.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **The Problem:** Identifying a disease-relevant target is only half the battle. The target must also be something that a drug can effectively bind to and modulate.\n    *   **AI's Solution:** AI models can be trained on data about known druggable targets and their structural features. They can then predict, based on the structure and characteristics of a newly identified target, whether it's likely to be a good candidate for drug development. This saves significant time and resources by filtering out targets that are unlikely to yield successful drugs early on.\n\n4.  **Accelerating Hypothesis Generation and Testing:**\n    *   **Traditional Approach:** Hypothesis generation in target ID can be slow, relying on extensive manual research and experimentation.\n    *   **AI's Approach:** AI can rapidly sift through literature, identify emerging trends, and suggest novel hypotheses about potential targets. These hypotheses can then be prioritized for experimental validation, making the entire process much more efficient.\n\n**Why this is a \"New Development\":**\n\nWhile the concepts of multi-omics and network biology aren't entirely new, the *scale* and *sophistication* with which AI can now analyze these complex systems represent a significant leap forward. Previously, integrating and making sense of such vast, diverse biological datasets was a monumental challenge. AI provides the tools to unlock the insights hidden within this data, leading to the identification of more promising and potentially novel drug targets.\n\n**In essence, AI is transforming target identification and validation from a labor-intensive, often serendipitous process into a more data-driven, predictive, and efficient endeavor.** This sets the stage for more effective and faster drug development pipelines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies leading the charge in **AI-driven target identification and validation**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
